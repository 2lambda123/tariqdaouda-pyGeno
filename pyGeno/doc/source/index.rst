pyGeno: A python package for Personalized Proteogenomics
========================================================

Introduction
--------------

pyGeno's `lair is on Github`_.

.. _lair is on Github: http://www.github.com/tariqdaouda/pyGeno

pyGeno is a python module mainly intended for **personal medicine** applications that revolve around **genomics** and **proteomics** (proteogenomics).

It integrates:

* **reference sequences** and annotations from **Ensembl**

* genomic polymorphisms from the **dbSNP** database

* data from **next-gen** sequencing

into an easy to use, memory-efficient and fast framework. In a nutshell it opens up the **specific** genomes and proteomes of your patients,
so you can concentrate on the important questions.

That being said, you do not need patients to enjoy pyGeno. This package should be able to handle any diploid **reference** genome made available by Ensembl.

pyGeno is developed by `Tariq Daouda`_ at the *Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer* (IRIC_), its logo is the work of the freelance designer `Sawssan Kaddoura`_.
