pyGeno TODO List:
===================
Theses are the things i'm currently working on.

2013-04-12

- Change SNP format to VCF (variant call format). Used by 10000 genome, seems like a goor format
	- Write VCFtools
	- Open VCF files using using a SecureMMap
		- Create a light index to reference position of SNPs in file according to their position in the chromosome/genome
		- Or use a SQL database for the reference. This approach might be more flexible in the sens that it might allow for more flexible searches of SNP
		- In this case i might also move all dbSNP infos to a SQL db.

- Simplify the importation of data
	- Make it as easy as possible to make packages (fasta + gene annotation set)
	- Make one big data file for all the genome

- The current way of defining the data path is highly dependent on the loader and doesn't seen to work with MAC
	- Use a environement variable for the data path, if the variable is not set create a folder in the Home
